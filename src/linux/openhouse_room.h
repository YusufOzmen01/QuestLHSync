// The driver's room, published for tools that align the lighthouse frame to something
// else (QuestLHSync): POSIX shared memory /openhouse-room-<uid> (Linux).
//
// Poses are in the host's raw tracking frame (what the base stations and devices are
// reported in: WorldFromDriver * pose). "settled" says the room has stopped moving: no
// base has moved for kSettleTime and every visible base is placed. "epoch" changes when
// a settled room differs from the last settled one (a base moved, or was added): what
// was measured against the old poses is stale. A reader takes the room only while
// "beat" is fresh (the driver writes it every 0.25 s) and the pid is alive.
//
// A copy of openhouse include/lh/room_shm.h: keep the two the same.
